# Flutter PS5 Controller Customization App

This Flutter project showcases advanced `CustomPainter` usage by creating a vectorized PS5 controller that users can customize. The app allows for color changes through a selector and offers additional styles for further personalization of the controller design.

## Features

- **Vectorized PS5 Controller**: Utilize `CustomPainter` to draw a detailed, vectorized representation of the PS5 controller.
- **Color Customization**: A color picker lets users change the controller's color to their preference.
- **Design Variations**: Users can switch between two additional controller designs, enabling further stylization.
